                    <p class="card-text">Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people
                        think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental
                        disorder.
                        <br />
                        Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.
                        <br />
                        However, this link also works in the other direction. Factors in people’s lives, interpersonal
                        connections, and physical factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions.
                        <br />
                        Looking after mental health can preserve a person’s ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching
                        a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.
                        <br />
                        Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a person’s
                        routine.
                        <br />
                        Although the term mental health is in common use, many conditions that doctors recognize as
                        psychological disorders have physical roots.
                        <br />
                        In this article, we explain what people mean by mental health and mental illness. We also describe the
                        most common types of mental disorders, including their early signs and how to treat them.
                        The WHO stress that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.”
                        Peak mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness
                        and happiness.
                        <br />
                        They also emphasize that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as
                        well as throughout different communities and societies the world over.
                        <br />
                        In the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimate that almost 1 in 5 adults
                        experience mental health problems each year.
                        <br />
                        In 2017, an estimated 11.2 million adultsTrusted Source in the U.S., or about 4.5% of adults, had a
                        severe psychological condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).</p>
